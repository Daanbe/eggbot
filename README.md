Solver-related commands:
- !solve [scramble] - optimally solve a scramble (3x3 or 4x4)
- !eggsolve [scramble] - find all optimal solutions (3x3 or 4x4)
- !goodm [scramble] - find good moves for a scramble (3x3 or 4x4)
- !video [scramble] - same as !solve but also generates a video
- !analyse [solution] - analyse a solution and find mistakes
- !analyse3x3 - upload a file containing solutions (one per line). calculates how many were optimal, +2, +4, etc.

Scramble/solution-related commands:
- !rev [solution] - reverse the solution of scramble, use RLUD notation, you can also use numbers like in slidysim

- !solvable [scramble] - check if a position is solvable

Misc. commands:
- !getprob [NxM] mo[N=1] [moves-range] [repetitions=1] - compute probability of an NxM single/mean having an optimal solution length within a given range of moves, after some number of attempts
- !paint [size] - paint image into slidysim scramble, use size to  make it custom puzzles size (up to 256), you should upload image as attachment 
- !8fmc [N=100] - generate N random scrambles and optimal solution lengths, for use with 8 puzzle 100x fmc
